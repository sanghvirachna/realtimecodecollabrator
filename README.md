## Features üåü

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Work concurrently with multiple developers, witnessing changes in real-time.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Code in your preferred language with support for C, C++, Java and Python.
- **Run Code:** Run the code in the same environment.
- **Rich Code Editor Features** Harnessing the power of CodeMirror, it has features of syntax highlighting for multiple languages, search and find code using (Ctrl + F )shortcut,  move your code line up-down using (Alt + up/down) arrow, code wrapper,etc.

## Technologies Used Ô∏è

### Core Technologies

- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. ([Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/))
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development and a wide range of tools and libraries. ([Official Documentation](https://nodejs.org/))

### Libraries and Tools

- **CodeMirror:** A versatile in-browser code editor providing features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and collaborative editing. ([Official Documentation](https://codemirror.net/))
- **Compilex:** A dynamic code execution engine that allows running code in real-time, supporting multiple programming languages. ([Official Documentation](https://link-to-compilex-documentation))
